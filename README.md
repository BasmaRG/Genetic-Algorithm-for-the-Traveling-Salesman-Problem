# Genetic-Algorithm-for-the-Traveling-Salesman-Problem
A population based stochastic algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Also produces a graph with the progress over time:

This program is also capable of producing a 2D heat map for determining the optimal parameters but I have not included an image of this.

## Usage
Navigate to Main.class after compiling and run the following command:
```
java Main
```
